This was my first a little more project in Java working with database Oracle. 
This application is for service smartphone.
The code is ugly and has a some bugs, because I learned Java by writing this project. When writing a project I didn't know the rules of creating a clean code. I break writing this project because I started learn new technologies making work easier.
Program functions:
- add new orders
- add new customers
- downloading data from KRS (You have to enter a NIP number and other data will be automatically saved)
- downloading picture smartphone with website mgsm.pl and display in new window
- display new and old orders
- simple search

Missing functions that I wanted to introduce:
- creating invoices
- admin panel
- panel for service
- login panel
